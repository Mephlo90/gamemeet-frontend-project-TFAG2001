GameMeet – TFAG2001 Web Development Essentials
----------------------------------------------

Project Description
-------------------
GameMeet is a UX-focused web project designed to explore how people can find and organize board game, card game, and role-playing game sessions, either in person or online.

The main goal of the project was to design a clear, approachable, and user-friendly experience for players who want to join or host game sessions without friction. The platform focuses on discoverability, clarity, and ease of use rather than complex social features.

The project consists of three main pages:

- Home / Index – Allows users to browse available game sessions and filter them by location, game type, or date.

- Create Session – Enables users to create their own game sessions by filling out a structured form.

- Profile – Simulates a user profile where players can manage personal information and view sessions they have joined or created.

This project does not aim to be a fully functional product, but rather a working prototype that demonstrates user-centered design decisions, interaction patterns, and accessibility considerations.


Setup & Installation
--------------------
No special setup is required to run this project.

There is:

- No backend

- No database

- No authentication system

All data is handled locally to support rapid prototyping and UX testing.

How to Run Locally
------------------
Clone or download the repository

Open the project folder in your code editor

Open index.html directly in your browser
(Alternatively, use a live server extension for easier testing)

No build tools or dependencies are required.

Known Limitations
-----------------
There is no real user authentication or persistence beyond local storage

Sessions and profiles are simulated rather than stored in a database

The project does not support real-time updates or multi-user interaction

Usability testing was limited in scope and conducted informally

These limitations were accepted intentionally to keep the scope manageable and focus on UX fundamentals rather than technical complexity.

Future Improvements
-------------------
Given more time and resources, the project could be expanded with:

A proper login and registration flow

Real user profiles with persistent data

Advanced filtering and search capabilities

Improved onboarding for first-time users

Expanded accessibility testing with assistive technologies

Mobile-first refinements based on user testing feedback

Future iterations would also benefit from additional usability testing sessions and validation with a broader range of users.

UX & Design Notes
-----------------
The design process followed a user-centered approach, starting from identifying player needs and frustrations when organizing game sessions.

Layouts were designed to prioritize readability, simplicity, and clear call-to-action elements.

Accessibility was considered through semantic HTML, clear visual hierarchy, and keyboard navigability.

The project evolved from low-fidelity wireframes to a high-fidelity interactive prototype, with iterative improvements based on feedback and self-evaluation.
